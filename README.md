This is a [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) theme, and requires it and Sublime Text 2/3 to work. It was made to be compatible with [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme)'s Pale Night scheme, which requires Sublime Text 3 to work.

Source adapted from the ArcDark theme packaged with MarkdownEditing, which I like quite a bit except that it clashed with the Material (Pale Night) theme, with slight tweaks for legibility because of the color swaps.

Borrowing avivace's awesome demo file (see it and his cool Monokai theme [here](https://github.com/avivace/monokaiC)) for an example screenshot:
